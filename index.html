	<h2> Introduction </h2>
	    <p> 
			Ralph lives in Florida with his elderly owners.
			His little legs make it hard for him to take long walks
			on the beach, but he doesnt allow his phyiscal limitaions to
			stop him from pursuing his passions. He loves the feeling of the waves on
			his feet and the sand between his paws.
